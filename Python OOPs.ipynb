        "#1.What is Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)?\n",
        "-In OOP, objects are created from templates called \"classes\", which define the properties and behavior of the objects they create. It lets you structure your code by grouping related properties and behaviors into individual objects. You create classes as blueprint and instantiate them to form objects.\n",
        "#2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-Classes are blueprint/template for creating an object\n",
        "#3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-Object is an instance of a class\n",
        "#4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details, emphasizing the essential characteristics of an object or system. It provides a high-level view and simplifies complexity. Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods within a class, restricting direct access to the internal state of an object. It ensures data protection and enables controlled access to the objects attributes.\n",
        "#5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "-dunder methods are special in built methods in Python. They are defined with surrounding double underscore. They are used to define custom objects\n",
        "#6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-Inheritance as the name suggest is inheriting all the attributes and methods of the parent class by the child class\n",
        "#7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-Polymorphism is taking different state/form. It refers to an object taking different forms depending on the method/data\n",
        "#8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected.\n",
        "#9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- Constructors in Python is a special class method for creating and initializing an object instance at that class. Every Python class has a constructor; it's not required to be defined explicitly. The purpose of the constructor is to construct an object and assign a value to the object's members\n",
        "#10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "-Static method cannot access or modify any class attributes however Classmethod can access and modify attributes associated to the class for all instances\n",
        "#11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-Method overloading happens within the same class. It is when the value of an attribute is overloaded with another value.\n",
        "#12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-Overriding is when a child or derived class changes the behavior/data of a parent class attribute.\n",
        "#13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-property decorator is a built-in Python decorator that allows you to turn class methods into properties.Property decorators allows to use class method as an attribute without the need of (). Private variables can be accessed using Property decorators.\n",
        "#14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "-Polymorphism allows to overload and overwrite a function. overloading can be achieved by passing more attributes in the child function and overwriting can be achieved by passing a new value in the child class for a parent attribute.\n",
        "#15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "-An abstract class in Python is used to hide complex implementation to hide the unneeded and expose the required.\n",
        "#16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "-OOPs allows developers to divide a complex software system into small, manageable objects. Each object is responsible for a specific function.\n",
        "#17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-Class variables are shared by all the instances of the class however instance variable is only accesable by that instance of the class\n",
        "#18.What is multiple inheritance in Python1\n",
        "-Multiple inheritance is when a child class inherits the attributes from 2 different parent classes\n",
        "#19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "-__str__() is for creating a readable representation of an object for end-users. __repr__() is for creating a detailed and precise representation for developers.\n",
        "#20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python1\n",
        "-'super()' function is used to refer to the parent class or superclass. It allows you to call methods defined in the superclass from the subclass, enabling you to extend and customize the functionality inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "#21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "-__del__ method is a dundar method which enables to delete a existing method\n",
        "#22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-@static method cannot access or modify any class attributes however @classmethod get access and modify attributes associated to the class for all instances\n",
        "#23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-Polymorphism can be achieved through overloading or overwriting.In inheritance overloading can be achieved by passing more attributes in the child function and overwriting can be achieved by passing a new value in the child class for a parent attribute.\n",
        "#24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-Method chaining allows us to call multiple methods on an object in a single, continuous line of code.\n",
        "#25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "-The main idea of __call__ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function.\n",
